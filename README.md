#React Context Api Task
I get JSON data and create a cart page with per item price , per item quantity,
Total quantity and total amount using useContext hooks.

useContext:The useContext hook is a way to access the shared data in a functional component without having to use the Consumer component.

In this task we can increase the quantity and decrease the quantity,see the remaining stocks available.

Next we see the totalquantity and totalprice and how much quantity we added.
